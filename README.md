## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Fork This Repository

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page
2. This creates your own copy of the repository

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets

Your TARUMT credentials need to be stored securely in GitHub:

1. Go to your **forked repository** on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add the following two secrets:

   | Secret Name | Value |
   |------------|-------|
   | `TARUMT_USERNAME` | Your TARUMT student ID |
   | `TARUMT_PASSWORD` | Your TARUMT portal password |

   **How to add a secret:**
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `TARUMT_USERNAME`
   - Secret: Your actual TARUMT username
   - Click "Add secret"
   - Repeat for `TARUMT_PASSWORD`

> ⚠️ **Security Note**: Your credentials are encrypted and never exposed. They're only used by GitHub Actions to fetch your timetable.

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

This makes your timetable file publicly accessible for calendar subscriptions:

1. In your repository, go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select:
   - **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait ~1 minute for deployment

### Step 4: Get Your Subscription URL

After GitHub Pages is enabled, your calendar subscription URL will be:

```
https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/tarumt-calendar-sync/timetable.ics
```

**Example:**
If your GitHub username is `johnsmith`, the URL would be:
```
https://johnsmith.github.io/tarumt-calendar-sync/timetable.ics
```

### Step 5: Test the Workflow

Before subscribing, let's make sure everything works:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on **Update Timetable Daily** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**
4. Wait for it to complete (green checkmark ✅)
5. Check that `timetable.ics` file appears in your repository

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Automatic Updates

The GitHub Action workflow runs automatically:
- **Daily** at **6:00 AM UTC** (2:00 PM Malaysia Time)
- Fetches your latest class timetable from TARUMT portal
- Fetches your exam schedule (if available)
- Combines both into a single `.ics` file
- Publishes it via GitHub Pages

Your calendar apps will automatically refresh and show the latest schedule including exams!

### Manual Updates

You can also trigger an update manually:
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **Update Timetable Daily**
3. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**

---

## 🛠️ Local Development (Optional)

If you want to test or generate the timetable locally:

### Setup

1. Clone your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tarumt-calendar-sync.git
   cd tarumt-calendar-sync
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   TARUMT_USERNAME=your_student_id
   TARUMT_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

### Commands

```bash
# Generate combined timetable (classes + exams)
npm run generate

# Legacy: Generate exam timetable only
npm run generate-exam
```

The generated `.ics` files will open automatically on macOS.

> **Note:** The main `timetable.ics` file now includes BOTH classes and exams, so you typically only need to subscribe to one calendar!

---

## 📂 Generated Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `timetable.ics` | **Main file** - Combined class schedule AND exam timetable (subscribe to this!) |
| `ce-exam_timetable.ics` | Legacy exam-only file (generated separately if you run `npm run generate-exam`) |

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Workflow fails in GitHub Actions

**Check credentials:**
- Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
- Verify `TARUMT_USERNAME` and `TARUMT_PASSWORD` are set correctly
- Re-add them if needed

**No timetable data:**
- This is normal if the semester hasn't started yet or exams aren't scheduled
- The workflow will complete successfully and generate what's available
- Classes will appear once the semester starts
- Exams will appear once they're scheduled in the system

### Calendar not updating

**Apple Calendar:**
- Right-click the calendar → **Refresh**
- Check subscription settings (should be set to "Every day")

**Google Calendar:**
- Google refreshes subscribed calendars every 24 hours
- Be patient or remove and re-add the subscription

**Outlook:**
- Right-click the calendar → **Update**

### Can't access subscription URL

**Check GitHub Pages:**
- Settings → Pages → Make sure it's enabled and deployed
- The URL should be: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/tarumt-calendar-sync/timetable.ics`

**Repository must be public:**
- Private repositories need GitHub Pro for Pages
- Make sure your repository is set to Public in Settings

---

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

1. **Keep your repository public** - Required for free GitHub Pages
2. **Don't share your credentials** - They're encrypted in GitHub Secrets
3. **Check Actions tab periodically** - Ensure daily updates are working
4. **Refresh calendar apps manually** - If you need immediate updates after a manual workflow run
5. **Fork, don't clone** - Forking makes it easier to get updates from the original repository

---

Your classmates can fork this repository and follow the same steps to create their own auto-updating timetable!

They can subscribe to this URL to see your schedule (useful for group projects or study sessions).
